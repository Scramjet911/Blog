So I started learning kotlin.
Android studio sucks. The number of cache issues really blows my mind, when developing things.
Coming from a web background, the web development world is miles ahead in debugging, building and deploying things. Expected since it is an old tech.
It is getting better but it really gets on my nerves when the crazy, cryptic error you were hunting after was an issue with some gradle cache, especially in react native.
